## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal playground for experimenting with modern front-end technologies that help build modern, high-quality web applications.
I use this project to prototype ideas, test integrations, and refine reusable components for future work.
If you're exploring frontend development or looking for practical examples of a modern tech stack in action, feel free to browse around!

ðŸ”§ The tech stack is:
 - Next.js
 - TypeScript
 - GraphQL
 - Apollo Client
 - Chakra UI
 - Next Intl
 - WeatherAPI
 - Vitest

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Tests
